This project was built as part of the HTML &amp; CSS Bootcamp (2025 Edition) by Colt Steele on Udemy. It serves as a hands-on practice of core HTML and CSS topics, including semantic markup, form elements, box model, text and box styling, Google fonts, pseudo-classes, CSS selectors, units, and more. Starter files were provided as part of the course.
